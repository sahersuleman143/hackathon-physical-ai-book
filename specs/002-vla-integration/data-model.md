# Data Model: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Integration

## Entity: VoiceCommand

**Description**: A spoken instruction that contains intent and parameters for robot action

**Fields**:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the command
- `text` (string): The transcribed speech text
- `timestamp` (datetime): When the command was received
- `confidence` (float): Confidence score from speech-to-text processing (0.0-1.0)
- `intent` (string): The interpreted intent from LLM processing
- `parameters` (object): Extracted parameters for the action
- `status` (enum): Current status (pending, processing, completed, failed)

**Validation rules**:
- Text must not be empty
- Confidence must be between 0.0 and 1.0
- Status must be one of the allowed values

## Entity: ActionPlan

**Description**: A sequence of discrete actions generated by the cognitive planning system to fulfill a command

**Fields**:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the action plan
- `voice_command_id` (string): Reference to the original voice command
- `actions` (array): Ordered list of action objects
- `status` (enum): Current status (pending, executing, completed, failed)
- `created_at` (datetime): When the plan was created
- `estimated_duration` (float): Estimated time to complete in seconds

**Action object structure**:
- `type` (string): Type of action (navigation, manipulation, detection)

**Validation rules**:
- Position coordinates must be valid floats
- Battery level must be between 0.0 and 1.0

- `robot_position` (object): Current robot position in the environment

**Object structure**:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the object
- `type` (string): Type/class of the object (cube, cup, etc.)
- `position` (object): 3D position coordinates
- `confidence` (float): Confidence in object detection (0.0-1.0)

**Validation rules**:
- Objects must have valid coordinates
- Confidence scores must be between 0.0 and 1.0

## Entity: UserIntent

**Description**: The understood purpose behind a voice command as interpreted by the LLM

**Fields**:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the user intent
- `voice_command_id` (string): Reference to the original voice command
- `primary_intent` (string): Primary action the user wants performed
- `parameters` (object): Extracted parameters from the command
- `confidence` (float): Confidence in intent interpretation (0.0-1.0)
- `created_at` (datetime): When the intent was processed

**Validation rules**:
- Primary intent must not be empty
- Confidence must be between 0.0 and 1.0

## Entity: ExecutionResult

**Description**: Result of executing an action or action plan

**Fields**:
- `id` (string): Unique identifier for the execution result
- `action_plan_id` (string): Reference to the action plan executed
- `results` (array): Individual results for each action
- `overall_status` (enum): Overall execution status (success, partial, failure)
- `execution_time` (float): Time taken for execution in seconds
- `timestamp` (datetime): When the execution completed

**Action result structure**:
