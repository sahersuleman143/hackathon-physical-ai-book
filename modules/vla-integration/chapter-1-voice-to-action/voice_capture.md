# Voice Capture

Voice capture is the first step in VLA processing.

- **Microphone Input:** Capture from standard microphones.
- **Audio File Input:** Pre-recorded audio can be used.
- **Sampling Rate & Quality:** Ensure standard audio quality (16kHz, mono).
- **Duration Limit:** Typically 0.1s to 30s for commands.

This ensures reliable transcription and processing downstream.
