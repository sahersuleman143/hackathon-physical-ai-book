# Basic Workflow

The VLA system follows a **structured workflow**:

1. **Audio Capture:** Capturing voice from the user.
2. **Speech-to-Text:** Using Whisper or similar models to transcribe audio.
3. **Command Validation:** Ensuring the text is a valid command.
4. **Intent Interpretation:** Mapping text to robot actions.
5. **Action Planning:** Planning the robot's motion or behavior.
6. **Execution:** Executing actions on the robot.

This workflow ensures accurate, safe, and predictable robot control.
