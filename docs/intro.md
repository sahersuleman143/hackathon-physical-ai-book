# Physical AI Book Introduction

Welcome to the **Physical AI Book**, a comprehensive guide to bridging **Artificial Intelligence** and **Robotics**.  
This book is designed for AI students and developers who want to transition from **digital AI systems** to **humanoid and embodied AI systems**.

---

## 📘 About This Book

This textbook focuses on **Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics**, where intelligence is not only computed but **embodied in physical systems**.

You will learn how to:

- Understand **ROS 2** as the nervous system of modern robots
- Connect AI algorithms to physical robots using **Python** and **rclpy**
- Design and model humanoid robots using **URDF**
- Prepare robots for **simulation, control, and real-world deployment**

---

## 🧱 Book Structure

The book is organized into **hands-on learning modules**, each building on the previous one.

### Module 1: ROS 2 Foundation
- ROS 2 concepts and architecture  
- Nodes, topics, services, and actions  
- Writing robotic agents in Python  
- Modeling humanoid robots using URDF  

Future modules will expand into:
- Embodied AI decision-making  
- Simulation-to-reality transfer  
- AI agents controlling humanoid robots
