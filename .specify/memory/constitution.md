# AI/Spec-Driven Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot Constitution

## Core Principles

### Accuracy
All content and chatbot answers must be factually correct. Every statement in the book and every response generated by the chatbot must be verified against reliable sources. No unverified claims or hallucinations are acceptable.

### Clarity
Content must be clear and structured for technical and semi-technical readers. Documentation, code, and explanations should follow consistent patterns and terminology to ensure accessibility across different skill levels.

### Consistency
Maintain uniform style, terminology, and structure throughout the book and codebase. All components of the system should follow established patterns and conventions to ensure predictability and maintainability.

### Reproducibility
All code examples and processes described in the book must be verifiable and reproducible. Every technical instruction should be tested and confirmed to work as described, with clear steps and expected outcomes.

### Usability
The chatbot must answer questions only from selected book text. Responses should be grounded in the provided source material and not generate information outside the scope of the book content.

## Standards and Technologies

### Book Platform
The book must be built using Docusaurus and deployed to GitHub Pages. All content should be written in markdown format with consistent structure and styling to ensure proper rendering and navigation.

### Development Tools
Use Spec-Kit Plus and Claude Code as primary development tools. All project artifacts, specifications, and implementations should follow the Spec-Driven Development methodology with proper documentation and traceability.

### Chatbot Implementation
The chatbot must be implemented using OpenAI Agents/ChatKit, FastAPI, Neon Postgres, and Qdrant. The system architecture should follow modern RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) patterns with proper vector storage and retrieval mechanisms.

### Quality Standards
Zero plagiarism is required. All content must be original or properly attributed. The system must maintain high standards for both content quality and technical implementation.

## Constraints and Requirements

### Book Length
The book must contain at least 50 pages of markdown content. Content should be comprehensive enough to cover the topic thoroughly while maintaining quality over quantity.

### Chatbot Accuracy
The chatbot must provide accurate responses that are grounded only in the book text. No responses should be generated from external sources or hallucinated information.

### Deployment Requirements
The book must be deployed to GitHub Pages and the backend must use serverless architecture. The system should be scalable, maintainable, and follow cloud-native best practices.

### Code Quality
All code must be fully functional and tested. Every component should include appropriate tests to verify correctness, performance, and reliability.

## Governance

This constitution serves as the foundational document for the AI/Spec-Driven Book with Embedded RAG Chatbot project. All development activities, design decisions, and implementation choices must align with these principles and requirements. Any changes to this constitution require formal amendment procedures with proper documentation and approval. All team members must ensure compliance with these principles throughout the development lifecycle.
